- üëã Hello, welcome to my profile! My name is Luiz Henrique and I'm an undergraduate student in Social Sciences at University of S√£o Paulo. 

- ‚ú® Political Science, Public Policies and Data Analysis are my favorite study topics. Here, on my GitHub, you'll find some R code that explores datasets related to these topics (directly or indirectly).

- üëÄ To get to know a bit about my work, I would like to highlight some brief analysis below about:
  - [Internet Movie Data Base (IMDb)](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/explorando-IMDb/)
  - [Party membership in Brazil](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/filiacao-partidaria-br-202307/)
  - [Brazil Human Development Index](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/DataViz-de-olho-no-idhm/)
  - [Access to social benefits](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/cgu_beneficios_sociais/)
 
- ‚è±Ô∏è I'll be posting more analysis here soon!
