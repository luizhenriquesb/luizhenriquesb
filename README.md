- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my profile! My name is Luiz Henrique and I'm an undergraduate student in Social Sciences at University of SÃ£o Paulo, currently in my sixth semester. 

- ðŸ‘€ Political Science, Public Policies and Data Analysis are my favorite study topics. Here, on my GitHub, you'll find some R code that explores datasets related to these topics (directly or indirectly, some more, some less).

- To get to know a bit about my work, I would like to highlight some brief analysis below about:
  - [Internet Movie Data Base (IMDb)](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/explorando-IMDb/)
  - [Party filiation in Brazil](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/filiacao-partidaria-br-202307/)
  - [Brazil Human Development Index](https://luizhenriquesb.github.io/DataViz-de-olho-no-idhm/)
